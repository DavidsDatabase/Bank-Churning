# Bank Churning

### Project Overview

This project focuses on customers with different backgrounds and circumstances to see if there is churn with the bank. There are credit scores, age groups, number of products, tenure and many more factors that goes into determining if the customer would stop doing business with the bank. Like any business, banks would greatly benefit if they are able to determine if there is churn so that they can take the initiative in preventing it from happening. 

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammeshram579/bank-customer-churn-prediction/data/>. The provided excel file is labeled Churn_Modelling_Copy.csv

### Tools Used

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Excel - EDA
- Excel - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data loading and Joining
2. Data Cleaning and Sorting
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. Which credit scores were most commonly associated with customers who exited the bank?
2. Is there any connection between product ownership and customer churn?
3. Does a customer's age impact their tendency to exit the bank?
4. Is there a relationship between customer tenure and their likelihood of exiting the bank?

### Results/Findings

1. We found that customers with "Fair" credit scores tend to exit the bank the most compared to other credit scores. This is also true for both genders.
2. Customers with only 1 product from the bank tend to exit the most compared to multiple product users. Another note, we found that users with 4 products have all exited the bank.
3. "Old" customers whose over the age of 55 had the highest percentage in exiting the bank. 36.75% of "old" users have churned, which is a little more than 1/3 of users.
4. We found users that had been with the bank for years 1 through 5 were most likely to churn compared to newly acquired users and users who had stayed past 5 years.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

We recommend trying to retain the customers as soon as they are acquired. The rate of churning appears to happen after year 1, so any time before that is crucial. We may also recommend to target customers with higher than "Fair" credit scores as the higher the credit score, the less likely the customers are to churn. Afterwards, we may suggest to promote other business products to the customers to have them stay with the business as most customers tend to churn with only 1 product.

### Limitations

This provided dataset was limited to a certain extent. More context and information may be needed to fully depict the accuracy of customer churn. Maybe conduct a survey for these individual customers to gauge their satisfaction levels with the business. This may help determine if the customer is likely to churn or not.
